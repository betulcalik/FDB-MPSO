### 1. MPSO Algorithm

<p>In expert systems, complex optimization problems are usually nonlinear, nonconvex, multimodal and discontinuous. As an efficient and simple optimization algorithm, particle swarm optimization(PSO) has been widely applied to solve various real optimization problems in expert systems. However, avoiding premature convergence and balancing the global exploration and local exploitation capabilities of the PSO remains an open issue. To overcome these drawbacks and strengthen the ability of PSO in solving complex optimization problems, a modified PSO using adaptive strategy called MPSO is proposed. In MPSO, in order to well balance the global exploration and local exploitation capabilities of the PSO, a chaos-based non-linear inertia weight is proposed. Meanwhile, to avoid the premature convergence, stochastic and mainstream learning strategies are adopted. </p>

<p>In MPSO, the four major highlights are described below.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Chaotic-Based Inertia Weight </li>
    <li> Stochastic and Mainstream Learning Strategies </li>
    <li> Adaptive Position Updating Strategy </li>
    <li> Terminal Replacement Mechanism </li>
</ol>

<p>To verify MPSO’s convergence performance on various optimization
problems, comparison experiments on complex CEC2017 are carried out. The experiment results
and corresponding statistical analysis indicate that MPSO outperforms quite a few state-of-the-art
PSO variants and some other evolutionary algorithms proposed recently.</p>

### 2. FDB Method

Selection methods have an important role in the meta-heuristic search (MHS) process. However, apart from a few successful methods developed in the past, new and effective studies have not been found in recent years. It is known that solution candidates selecting from the population during the search process directly affects the direction and success of the search. In this study, a new selection method based on fitness-distance balance (FDB) is developed in order to solve the premature convergence problem in the MHS process. Thanks to the developed method, solution candidates with the highest potential to improve the search process can be determined effectively and consistently from the population.
